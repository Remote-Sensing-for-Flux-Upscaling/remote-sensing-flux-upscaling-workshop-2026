# Remote Sensing and Fluxes Upscaling for Real-world Impact workshop (March 2026) NEEDS TO BE UPDATED

## Introduction

Understanding and scaling land-atmosphere fluxes remains one of the final frontiers in Earth system science. While flux networks like AmeriFlux and NEON have matured into cornerstones for in situ monitoring, spatial integration with remote sensing and modeling still lacks systematic workflows and common standards. This is especially the case for supporting practical applications in agriculture, forestry, and urban planning.  
To address this challenge, the Flux Upscaling Working Group, led by members of AmeriFlux Management Project, NEON, and the Carbon Dew Community of Practice, brings together experts to advance the integration of flux and remote sensing data with the goal of developing a novel framework and define best practices that facilitate the effective use of these data sources.  
The "Remote Sensing and Fluxes Upscaling for Real-world Impact" workshop was held in June 2024 at the Berkeley Lab, Ca. It brought together experts from various fields to discuss and address the challenges of integrating remote sensing and flux data across different spatiotemporal scales and applications. 

## 2024 Remote Sensing and Fluxes Upscaling for Real-world Impact workshop
This repository contains materials from the 2024 Remote Sensing and Fluxes Upscaling for Real-world Impact workshop focused on analyzing and integrating remote sensing and flux data using Jupyter Notebooks. The workshop featured a series of presentations, which are outlined in the agenda included in this repository. 

The repository is organized as follows:
- **Hands-on Tutorial**: A collection of Jupyter notebooks providing tutorials and examples for working with remote sensing and flux data, designed to be run on Google Colab.
- **Presentations**: The workshop presentations, including slides and supporting materials, are presented in accordance with the agenda. The available slides are from speakers who have granted permission to make their material publicly available. 

To run the notebooks, simply open them in Google Colab and follow the instructions. This repository aims to provide a resource for participants and others interested in learning about remote sensing and flux data analysis and integration.

## Hands-on Tutorial
### Topic 1: From site-scale ...   
Creators: Nicola Falco (nicolafalco@lbl.gov), David Durden (ddurden@battelleecology.org), Stefan Metzger (smetzger@atmofacts.com)  

This topic focuses on site-scale analysis using remote sensing (RS) data:
- How to collect RS data using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Colab (Python API)
- How to process the data using practical codes, covering key steps such as:
    - Calculating vegetation indices
    - Visualizing data as maps
    - Extracting time-series information
    - Conducting quality assessment (QA)
    - Comparing RS time-series with tower flux data (Net Ecosystem Exchange, NEE)
    - Aggregating RS and flux time-series data
    - Modeling the relationship between vegetation indices and NEE using a linear model.

### Topic 2: ... over regional-scale connectivity ...
Creators: Nicola Falco (nicolafalco@lbl.gov), David Durden (ddurden@battelleecology.org), Stefan Metzger (smetzger@atmofacts.com)  

In Topic 2 of this tutorial, we explore regional-scale connectivity by:
- Applying the linear model developed in Topic 1 to estimate Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) over a small region, using a straightforward analysis approach
- Utilizing high-frequency flux spatialization to investigate additional factors influencing NEE in space, time, and process.

### Topic 3: ... to continental-scale connectivity
Creators: Danielle Losos (losos@wisc.edu), Paul Stoy (pcstoy@wisc.edu), Avanti Kekane (avkekane@wisc.edu), Sophie Hoffman (shoffman22@wisc.edu), Sadegh Ranjbar (sranjbar@wisc.edu), Ryan Abernathey (ryan@earthmover.io)  

In Topic 3, we scale up to continental connectivity by introducing the Advanced Baseline Imager Live Imaging of Vegetated Ecosystems ([ALIVE](https://alive-abi.github.io/alive/index.html)) workflow that we call 'ALIVE<sub>GPP</sub>', also described in this [google slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PJclqluGFHkp9LpHZ85_pgL8lFLLaAMsQcEGZ2DIGSU/edit#slide=id.p1) that was created for the workshop. The tutorial covers:
- How to work with [zarr](https://zarr.dev/) libraries created using [Icechunk](https://icechunk.io/en/latest/overview/#docs-organization) by [earthmover](https://earthmover.io/). We will use a zarr library that contains [Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) estimates](https://alive-abi.github.io/alive/daily-GPP.html) from the ALIVE worksflow.
- Leveraging data from the [Advanced Baseline Imager](https://www.goes-r.gov/spacesegment/abi.html) on the [Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites - R Series (GOES-R)](https://www.goes-r.gov/) to create ALIVE<sub>GPP</sub> for pixels that contain Ameriflux and NEON, Inc. towers as described in [Losos et al. (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03071-z)
- Using a machine learning model specifically a gradient boosting model described in [Ranjbar et al. (2024)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024MS004341), to estimate GPP at the native temporal resolution of the ABI CONUS scene, every 5 minutes, as described in [Losos et al. (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425725001634).
